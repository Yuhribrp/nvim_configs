# Neovim Personal Configs

Welcome to my personal Neovim development configurations repository!

I configured it using `lazy.nvim` by folke as plugin manager and `init.lua` as the cornerstone of my Neovim configuration, allowing you to specify settings, key mappings, and plugins.

I designed this configuration for use in my development ecosystem, which consists of `WSL2` and `ZSH`

This repository contains all the configurations and settings I use daily to enhance my development workflow. 

The current configurations focus primarily on **Ruby on Rails**, which is the main framework I work with. 

These settings are tailored to streamline my development process, ensuring efficiency and productivity.
